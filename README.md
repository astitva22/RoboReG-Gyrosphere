## Introduction
Gyrosphere is a **ball-shaped** mobile robot with spherical external shape typically made of a spherical shell serving as the body of the robot and an internal driving unit (IDU) that enables the robot to move. Gyrosphere typically moves by rolling over surfaces. The rolling motion is commonly performed by changing the robot's center of mass (i.e., pendulum-driven system).
