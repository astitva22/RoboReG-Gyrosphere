dec:
1st Week : PLannig of the design and features to added
	    ->orientation of the wheels
	    ->Tetrahedron design of the internal driving unit
	    ->Matplotlib plot of the design./
	    
2nd Week : Dynamics and Kinematics of the bot
	   -> Vector calculations of the net velocities given to the outer sphere.
	   -> Verification in pybullet simulation.
	   -> Few Setbacks of Tetrhedron design causing waste of valuable torque generated by 		      motors, concluded modification in design needed.
	   
3rd Week : Delivery of The URDF, Testing of kinematcis on the final urdf. Reading about MPC         and         geeting a basic algorithm.

4th Week :Implementing MPC(fixing the orientation of IDU) on URDF.

Jan: 
1st week in jan :  Establishing Manual control. Reading about localization. 
                   
2nd week : Implementation of Localization systems. 

3rd week : imporving Localization. Reading about Navigation and Path planning and get a basic algorithm.
           
4th week : Implementing Navigation and Path planning.


Simulation Software : Gazebo
for URDF desinging: Solid works + Blender(to get inertials and Frictional values to joints)
